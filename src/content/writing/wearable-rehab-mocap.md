I built a  **high-precision wearable motion capture & rehabilitation assessment system** designed for **stroke patients** to perform **home-based rehab training** with **3D motion reconstruction**.  







The system integrates multiple **hardware** and **software** technologies, covering **multi-IMU sensing**, **quaternion-based Kalman fusion**, **wireless streaming with UART interfacing**, and a **PC-side inverse kinematics (IK) evaluation tool** (MATLAB + OpenSim) to visualize motion and quantify joint **ROM (Range of Motion)**. The goal was simple: make rehab feedback **more objective, more accessible, and easier to use**. 🦾

### 🧩 System Overview

**Workflow: Capture → Fusion → Transmit/Store → IK Analysis → Rehab Metrics**

- Wearable device captures motion using **9-axis IMU modules**
- Firmware performs **real-time fusion** and outputs limbs angles
- Data is **transmitted over a wireless link with UART interfacing** to PC and also **logged to SD card**
- PC tool performs **inverse kinematics Algorithm** to replay motion and compute **ROM metrics**

  <em>Kalman Filtering Algorithm</em>
</p>

- Implemented a **Quaternion-based Kalman Filtering algorithm** to fuse data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, effectively solving Euler angle gimbal lock and sensor drift issues. 
- Developed the embedded firmware in **C/C++**on the **STM32L0 platform**, managing task scheduling and low-power operation. 
- Built a host analysis system using **MATLAB** to perform **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** Algorithm. This allows for precise reconstruction of limbs motions based on sensor data. 
- Ported the **FATFS file system** to enable high-speed, real-time offline storage of motion data onto an SD card via the SDIO interface.

### ⚙️ Hardware and Mechanical Design

  <em>Hardware Workflow</em>
</p>

- Designed a distributed hardware architecture using three **STM32L071 (Low Power)** MCUs. Two units act as sensor nodes (processing **IMU** data), while the central unit handles data aggregation and transmission. 

- Designed **custom PCB boards** integrating **TPS5430 power management** for stable voltage regulation and signal isolation to prevent digital noise from affecting analog measurements. 

- Integrated a **2.4G wireless transmission module (NRF24L01 based)** to replace traditional wired connections, allowing patients unrestricted movement range during rehabilitation exercises. 

- Modeled and manufactured **3D-printed PLA enclosures** using **Fusion360**. The design features a magnetic slide-lid mechanism and ergonomic strap mounts for easy patient wearability. (Thanks for my best friend Ruizhe Zhou's helps!)

### 💡  Key Innovations

- The system achieves an average knee joint angle measurement error of only **3°** through rigorous static and dynamic testing, meeting high accuracy. 
- **Inverse Kinematics Integration**: Unlike simple angle measurement devices, this system utilizes motion capture data for inversion. This provides doctors with clinically relevant **Range of Motion (ROM)** data for remote diagnosis. 
- The system focuses on **home-based rehabilitation**. It is lightweight, wireless, and includes a "push-pull" magnetic switch structure designed specifically for ease of use by stroke patients.

*This project aims to solve the issue of limited medical resources for stroke patients by enabling effective, unsupervised home rehabilitation training. It also demonstrates a full-stack integration of low-power embedded systems, sensor fusion algorithms, and animational modeling to achieve autonomous rehabilitation assessment.*
