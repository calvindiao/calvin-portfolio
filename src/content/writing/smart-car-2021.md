Participating again for the second year, we developed a **self-balancing electric motorcycle** that autonomously follows an electromagnetic track using self-designed magnetic sensors. Without the aid of a flywheel, the vehicle maintains stability through precise **real-time control algorithms**.







This project integrated a wide range of hardware and software technologies, including **electromagnetic signal processing**, **advanced fuzzy PID algorithms**, **power management IC design**, **schematic and PCB design**, and **embedded system integration** with MCU minimal circuit design, **I²C/UART/SPI** communication, and **DMA**-based data buffering.

---

### Software Development

- Implemented a **Kalman filtering algorithm** to estimate the motorcycle’s accurate tilt angle and attitude based on **IMU sensor fusion**.

- Developed all control logic in **C/C++**, ensuring efficient real-time performance on the embedded MCU platform.

- Designed a **fuzzy PID control algorithm** to handle the nonlinear coupling between tilt angle and steering dynamics, enhancing stability and responsiveness.

### Hardware and Mechanical Design

- Completed the **mechanical structure design** and **3D modeling** of the vehicle, optimizing the self-balancing mechanism for a lightweight and compact structure. (See Below Picture)
- Designed **multi-layer PCB boards** integrating a **minimal MCU control unit**, **MOSFET driver circuits**, and **multi-channel power management modules**.  
- Implemented **analog–digital separation** in the PCB design, isolating **power and signal analog circuits** from **digital MCU sections** to reduce interference and improve system stability.

---

### Competition-winning Features

- Achieved an elegant and stable mechanical design, where precise weight distribution and a refined self-balancing structure significantly reduced the load of the balance control algorithm.

- Designed a **miniaturized PCB**, effectively reducing overall vehicle weight and enhancing the system’s compactness and aesthetic integration.
