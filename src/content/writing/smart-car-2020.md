We designed and built a **Mecanum-wheeled smart vehicle capable of rapidly locating and autonomously positioning an acoustic beacon**.  







The project integrated multiple hardware and software technologies, covering **signal processing**, **control algorithms**, **embedded system design**, and **mechanical optimization**.

---

### 🧠 Software Development

- Implemented a multi-modal perception and control system, including **PID closed-loop control** and **Kalman filtering** for optimized attitude estimation and speed control.  
- Developed the main control logic in **C/C++**, supporting real-time algorithm debugging and optimization.  
- Integrated an **OpenMV (Python)** module for visual-assisted navigation, achieving **object recognition and localization**.  
- Applied **FFT** and **cross-correlation algorithms** for sound source localization, estimating direction by analyzing phase differences across a multi-microphone array.  
- Independently implemented a **path planning algorithm**, improving trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance efficiency.

### ⚙️ Hardware and Mechanical Design

- Completed the **mechanical structure design and modeling** of the entire vehicle, optimizing Mecanum wheel drive and chassis stability.  
- Designed **multi-layer PCB boards** integrating a **minimal MCU control unit**, **MOSFET driver circuits**, and **multi-channel power management modules**.  
- Implemented **high-speed signal shielding and protection circuits** to ensure stable operation under complex electromagnetic conditions.  
- Utilized an **IMU sensor** and **microphone array** for multi-source data fusion, enabling high-precision sound localization and motion control.

### 💡 Competition-winning Features

- The system employed **Dual MCU parallel computation**. One was dedicated to **vehicle control** and the other to **signal acquisition and processing**.  This separation significantly improved **system responsiveness** and **computational efficiency**.
- We dedicated and integrated a specialized **8-bit parallel ADC chip** for high-speed, high-precision data sampling, substantially improving signal accuracy compared to serial ADC solutions.
- Introduce **path prediction and dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithms** for more intelligent navigation.
